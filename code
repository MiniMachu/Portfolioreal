   This is me boxing in some gym in Delano against a kid called Taco. You can tell I'm inexperienced because I'm not rotating my hips to generate power, I am kinda plodding, and chin up when I throw. Almost two years ago now, so maybe I'm better. <br>

That's me boxing in some warehouse in Fresno against some kid named Alonzo, I think. It was unofficial competition that I probably lost if you actually scored it. I still find it cool.

      From the favelas of Guarujá, State of São Paulo, Brazil. Former 155 pound Lightweight Champ, but everyone knows he's still the champion. Fights for his poor community everytime he steps into the cage, and never in a boring fight. <br>
